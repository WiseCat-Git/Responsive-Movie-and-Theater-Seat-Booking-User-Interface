# Responsive-Movie-and-Theater-Seat-Booking-User-Interface

# Project Objectives and How They Were Achieved

# Prototype a Responsive Seat Map Visual Layout Maximizing Cross-Device Usage

Achievement: The HTML and CSS were carefully structured to create a responsive layout. Media queries were used to adjust the size of the seats and other elements based on different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). The layout scales smoothly, maintaining usability and aesthetic quality across devices.

# Connect the Visual Seat Map to a Grid of Seats (Columns and Rows) to be Used for Booking

Achievement: The seat map was designed using a grid layout, with each seat represented by a div element styled with CSS. Each row of seats was created as a row in the grid, allowing for easy mapping between the visual layout and a logical grid structure. 

This setup enables straightforward integration with backend booking systems.

# Change the Controls Dynamically, Depending on Screen Size, to Increase Booking Completions

Achievement: Responsive design principles were applied using media queries, ensuring that controls like seat selection and confirmation buttons are appropriately sized and positioned for different screen sizes. This ensures that the booking process is user-friendly on any device, which should help increase booking completions.

# Additional Features Implemented

Interactivity (Seat Selection and Price Calculation)

Achievement: JavaScript was added to enable interactivity in the seat booking interface. Users can click on seats to select or deselect them, with the selected seats highlighted. The number of selected seats and the total price are dynamically updated and displayed, providing immediate feedback to the user.

# Predefined Occupied Seats

Achievement: Specific seats were predefined as occupied and styled with a red color to indicate that they are unavailable. This feature improves the realism and usability of the interface, guiding users to available seats.

# Confirmation Button

Achievement: A confirmation button was added, allowing users to finalize their seat selection. This is a crucial step in the booking process, making the interface more practical for real-world use.

# Conclusion

This project successfully met and exceeded the initial objectives by creating a responsive, interactive seat booking interface that adapts to different devices and enhances the user experience. The final product is a robust prototype that can be easily integrated into a larger application or adapted for various booking scenarios. The additional features, like interactivity and predefined occupied seats, provide a polished and functional user interface.
